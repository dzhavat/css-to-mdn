# IMPORTANT (2022-01-01)

The extension was removed from the Marketplace. You can no longer install it in VS Code from there.

# Deprecation (2020-01-22)

The extension is now **deprecated** because VS Code supports the functionality natively.

As of [v1.38](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_38), VS Code supports the functionality provided by this extension natively as well! Iâ€™m quite happy about it because I didnâ€™t know that they were going to implement something similar. And whatâ€™s even better is that they also show a link to MDN for HTML elements! Now go and update to the latest version of VS Code. Itâ€™s worth it! ðŸ˜Ž

It will also be **removed** completely from the Marketplace after five VS Code releases.

The current VS Code release is 1.41.1.
